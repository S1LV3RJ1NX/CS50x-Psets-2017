1.  Basic integer types defined in C vary their sizes across platforms. Hence to make code more portable <stdint.h>
    was introduced which makes code portable and support new int types that remain same across various platforms.
    
2.  It tells us that int used is those many bits wide. e.g: int8_t is 8 bits wide.

3.  for 32bit architcture:
    BYTE is 1 byte
	DWORD is 4 bytes
	LONG is 4 bytes
	WORD is 2 bytes

4.  First two bytes of BMP file are WORD and DWORD; WORD denotes the file type; must be BM.
    DWORD denotes bfSize the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.

5.  bfSize specifies the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file. biSize specifies the size of the structure in bytes.

6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB (device-independent bitmap) and its origin is the upper left corner.

7.  The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure specifies he BMPâ€™s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)

8.  If file pointer returned NULL-->
        for line 24:
            it would return 2 giving msg the file could not be opened.
        for line 37:
            it would return 3 giving msg file could not be created.
        
9.  So that it will read from the file 1 time each time reading size = sizeof(RGBtriple).

10. It assigns the value 3

11. It allows us to rewind or fast-forward within the file. Specifically to seek from(move position ptr to)
    start, middle or at end of file.

12. SEEK_CUR indicates the current position of the position pointer.
